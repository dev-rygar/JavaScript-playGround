// To put in practice what I've learned in conditionals, we will make a basic Magic Eight Ball program.

// First I'll initialize a variable that will hold the user's name.
// Note: since I have some advance knowledge in javascript, I will change this program infuture where I can ask the user to input their name and save it to variable userName.

let userName = 'John' // My name

// This line of code will log a greet message that has a default message incase the userName is empty.
userName ? console.log(`Hello, ${userName}!`) : console.log('Hello!');

// I will initialize a variable that will hold our user's question.
let userQuestion = 'Am I in the right path?';
console.log(`User asked: ${userQuestion}`);

// Now we will initialize a variable that will generate a random number from 0 to 7 (7 is included).
// We will also use the Math built-in method floor and random to generate a random number and round down the random number.
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8)

// I will initialize a variable that will contain the answer of eightball later, base on the random number.
let eightBall = '';

// Now I am going to make the control flow/conditional
