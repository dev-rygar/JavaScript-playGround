// Early adults recieves a race number at or above 1000 (randomly)

// Others will receive 1000 below (randomly)

// Adult Registrants run at 9:30 AM or 11:00 AM
// Early adults run at 9:30 AM
// Late adults run at 11:00 AM

// Youth registrant run at 12:30 PM (regardless of registration; early or late.)
